# 16-bit-Carry-Lookahead-CLA-Adder
16-bit Carry Look-ahead Adder circuits designed by cascading the 4-bit adder circuit with carry logic.
– Tools & technologies used: EDA Playground, Verilog
– The carry lookahead adder (CLA) solves the carry delay problem by calculating the carry signals in advance, based
on the input signals.
– In this adder, the carry input at any stage of the adder is independent of the carry bits generated at the independent
stages.
– The disadvantage of CLA is that the carry logic block gets very complicated for more than 4-bits.
